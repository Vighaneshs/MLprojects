## How to run

* 1. Extract the zip file to a location.

* 2. Note that the data is already extracted and folders are present in the same directory as the code, as "enron1_test", "enron1_train".... If not, extract it.

* 3. Make sure you have python 3 and pip (3.10 to be exact).

* 4. Install the required libraries through the command 
```
pip install -r .\requirements.txt
```

* 5. Each algorithm has a python file associated to it,

For Naive Bayes, execute NB.py
```
python NB.py
```
For logistic Regression, execute LR.py
```
python LR.py
```
For logistic Regression, execute SGD.py
```
python SGD.py
```

* 6. Results will be printed in the console.

## Note:

* I have added python notebooks for reference, you may or may not execute those, but checkpoints are already saved for your convenience.

* Lines 301 to 306 in LR.py can be uncommented to see my experiments with Learning Rates, lambda and number of iterations. 

* For any query, feel free to e-mail me or send a message on teams.
